### [`Assignment`](https://zig.guide/language-basics/assignment/).

`(const|var) identifier[: type] = value`

- `const` indicates that `identifier` is a **constant** that stores an immutable value.
- `var` indicates that `identifier` is a **variable** that stores a mutable value.
- `: type` is a type annotation for `identifier`, and may be omitted if the data type of `value` can be inferred.

Constants and variables _must_ have a value. If no known value can be given, the [`undefined`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#undefined) value, which coerces to any type, may be used as long as a type annotation is provided.

### [`Arrays`](https://zig.guide/language-basics/arrays)

Arrays are denoted by `[N]T`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array and `T` is the type of those elements (i.e., the array's child type).

For array literals, `N` may be replaced by `_` to infer the size of the array.

```
const a = [5]u8{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
const b = [_]u8{ 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd' };
```
